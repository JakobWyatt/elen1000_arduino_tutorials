# Miscellaneous Microcontroller Code

This repository contains microcontroller code from a variety of units at Curtin University.
The aim of this repo is to make it easier to share microcontroller programming techniques amongst students.

This code is released under the CRAPL, and most of it has been designed to be used once and thrown away.
If you're looking for beautiful code and good software engineering practices, look elsewhere.
